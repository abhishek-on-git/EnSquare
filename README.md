# EnSquare
 An improved version of an Android game I built in my UG without using any game engine. 
 I first made this game for a competition at a technical festival at my UG University back in 2013; it had a lot of bugs back then as I was just starting out on Android.
 Created this new, bug free version and published it on Google playstore. 
 Available on Google playstore at : https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.game.ensquare
 
## How to play
   The game comprises of multi-colored squares, gold coins, treasures and bombs flying across the screen at high speeds. 
   Players need to drag their fingers across the screen - This creates an enclosing rectange on the gameview.
   To score one must enclose (or en-square, if I may) as much gold and squares as possible without enclosing any of the three kinds of bombs.
